3269,"yes , ballistic is silly ."
3270,a solid film . . . but more conscientious than it is truly stirring .
3271,"you will definitely want to make a reservation , as i ' ve seen lines snaking out around to the parking lot right before open ."

3313,"all - in - all , the film is an enjoyable and frankly told tale of a people who live among us , but not necessarily with us ."
3314,with artichokes and olives the cool cucumber dressing was a much better option .
3315,an unwise amalgam of broadcast news and vibes .
3316,she gets up without washing her hands and brings us our food .
3317,"remember , don ' t drink and drive ."
3318,"it ' s also , clearly , great fun ."
3319,no apologies either .

3347,"moody , heartbreaking , and filmed in a natural , unforced style that makes its characters seem entirely convincing even when its script is not ."
3348,i had to end up paying $1496 and that accounted for every single combination out there .
3349,"within minutes i received a call from the restaurant to inform me they no longer served the vegetable qorma , and so went with the spinach qorma instead ."
3350,my only word of caution is to either make a reservation or go prepared to wait because there is always a wait !

3375,"don ' t get me wrong , each course was delicious but those were the stars !"
3376,"and the flower girl is very shy , and did not want her hair done , so we just had a bridesmaid put a bow in it rather than force her to sit in a chair with a stylist ."

3420,supposed to text when ready .
3421,it was to the point where i almost completely lost hope .

3424,highly recommend going somewhere else .
3425,"nelson ' s brutally unsentimental approach . . . sucks the humanity from the film , leaving behind an horrific but weirdly unemotional spectacle ."
3426,"about a manga - like heroine who fights back at her abusers , it ' s energetic and satisfying if not deep and psychological ."
3427,"what the film lacks in general focus it makes up for in compassion , as corcuera manages to find the seeds of hope in the form of collective action ."

3438,the casino had many slots and games .
3439,i was looking forward to our meal .
3440,they takes a long time to get to its gasp - inducing ending .
3441,"it was my first time here , and i was excited about going ."
3442,the menu is huge and posted on the wall ( and there are menus ) .
3443,it was definitely a fast paced situation .
3444,they contract the work out to the local jiffy lube .
3445,"except their typical long lines out the door , especially on super hot days that would normally keep most sane people to shelter indoor ."
3446,it was met with a smirk and defiance .
3447,they are not american chinese food and really delicious .
3448,i got a headache watching this meaningless downer .
3449,but tiny portions of crab !

3459,we had another server on her ' first day ' .
3460,"it is true that the box that the cupcakes come in as a group is not great , my cupcakes did indeed fall over inside the box ."
3461,"if you ask for a better car , price is jacked up ."
3462,"and they have a coupon where if you spend $20 you get free egg rolls , spend $30 free crab rangoons , spend $40 and you get free dumplings ."
3463,"i thought it was a breakfast place where you could waffles , eggs , bacon , etc ."
3464,the donuts were truly about the best part of the entire meal .
3465,more of a preppy upper scale bar gay friendly !
3466,bryan was the mechanic recommended to me .
3467,so now i ' m alone at the krispy kreme counter .
3468,i spent several years working in fine dining and was amazed at how nina didn ' t even break a sweat .

3476,portioning of the octopus could have been better .
3477,we moved from texas to canada .
3478,"i live in their delivery area , and went as paperless as possible because important mail ( bank and retirement account statements , bills , insurance and health care info , etc ) was constantly mis - delivered ."
3479,"if i had been thinking about the visual medium , they would have been doing something wrong ."
3480,my boyfriend got a 5 egg omelet .
3481,the plot convolutions ultimately add up to nothing more than jerking the audience ' s chain .
3482,"the whole is quite entertaining , but despite its virtues , there is an unsettled feeling to the film ."
3483,"i then proceeded to wait patiently for my order , knowing that was not fast food , its lamb and its delicate ."
3484,after a horrific experience with merry maids - 480 948-3325 - where after reconfirming three x's - i took off work to meet them - they never showed up to my home after waiting for 4 hours - i was looking for a new cleaning service .
3485,the salad was so gross and wilted .
3486,tonight i ordered the chicken alfredo at about 4:00 pm .
3487,please support this great fundraiser .
