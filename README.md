# CIL Project

`train_and_save_model.py` trains and saves our model results,  
while `dece_and_baselines.ipynb` uses these models in an ensemble to produce the final results.

The required data is provided in the `data/` folder.  
All preprocessing techniques can be found in the `preprocessing/` folder.
The postprocessing techniques, including our DECE approach and code for the plots in the report can be found in the `preprocessing/` folder.
